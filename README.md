# Shooting Game

This is a smartphone app that uses Flutter to recreate a shooting game.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Usage
### Setup
We have tested the operation in Android Studio.

This site (https://www.flutter-study.dev/getting-started/install) can help you set up your development environment.

To resolve package dependencies, run 'flutter pub get' in the terminal.
This will run on the actual machine or emulator.
If the package contaion updates, run 'flutter pub get' again.

### Demo

Running 'main.dart' will work.

- 'main.dart' is a main program.
- 'pubspec.yaml' is an important file that contaions information about the packages and libraries that the Flutter project depends on. 'dependencies' section lists each package used by the project and its version.

Running on the actual device is recommended
(this is because this application uses the video from the camera devices).

*Confirmation of operation is in progress.
